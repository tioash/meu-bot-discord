# meu-bot-discord

Ah, working with some Discord bot modules, I see! These imports look like the groundwork for creating a bot that interacts with Minecraft servers. Here’s a brief overview of what each module does:

discord: This is the main module for creating a Discord bot. It provides classes and functions to interact with Discord’s API.

discord.ext.commands: This extension provides a framework for creating commands for your bot, making it easier to handle user inputs.

discord.Embed: Used to create rich text messages (embeds) in Discord. Great for formatting messages with colors, images, and more.

discord.ui.Button and discord.ui.View: These are used for creating interactive buttons within messages, allowing users to interact with your bot.

mcstatus.MinecraftServer: This is a module to query the status of a Minecraft server, such as whether it’s online, the number of players, etc.

mcrcon.MCRcon: This module allows remote control of a Minecraft server via the RCON protocol, useful for sending commands to the server.
